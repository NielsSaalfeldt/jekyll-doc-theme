              <p class="lead" align = "justify"> Our project consisted in creating a data set of the available jobs in Switzerland and to be able to map them. 
              We scrapped from the website <a href="https://www.indeed.ch/">Indeed.ch</a> and used the leaflet package. We came up with this
          idea because we are currently looking for an internship.Therefore we decided to use the opportunity of this course
          to build an app that would enable and help us to reach our ultimate goal. </p>
          <p class = "lead" align = "justify"> Our app allows the user to filter jobs category according to the domain he wishes to engage itself. 
            The categories are the following : Marketing, HR, Data Science, Consulting, Accounting/Finance, Business,
            Management, Economics, Communication. We chose to focus on these categories as they are inline with our studies, other categories
            seemed not relevant scrapping and time consuming. To know more about our app click on the <strong> LEARN MORE</strong> button to
            know more about it. Enjoy!</p>
