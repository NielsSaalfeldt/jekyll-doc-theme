<p align ="justify">I am a girl from the west coast of Norway. I moved to Copenhagen in 2015 to pursue my bachelor degree in Economics and Business Administration at Copenhagen Business School (CBS). During my bachelor I went on exchange to Mexico City for a semester. In 2018 I finnished my bachelor degree and started on my master degree of EBA in  Finance and Investments, which led me to this exchange semester at HEC Lausanne before writing my master thesis the coming spring. 

I chose to go on exchange to Switzerland on exchange as i love to go skiing. This is something I've done since I was five years old, as I grew up in a small town in Norway five minutes away from a skiing resort. This has made me enjoy nature and the possibilities this brings.</p>

<p align ="justify">I'm from Oslo, Norway and currently on exchange to Universit√© de Lausanne HEC from my home university, Copenhagen Business School where I pursue a Master of Science in Economics and Business Administration with a specialization in Finance and Strategic Management.

I decided to go to Lausanne because of the beautiful nature surrounding the city. Since my arrival I have enjoyed the lake and the mountains and look forward to go hiking in the autumn and skiing during winter.</p>

</p>
<p align ="justify">I am pursuing my master's degree in Economics at the University of Stuttgart-Hohenheim in the south of Germany, but originally I come from Cologne. I decided to go to Lausanne for an exchange semester as I love the mountains as well as the lake and I can easily combine the courses at HEC with my specializations in macroeconomics and econometrics at home. As I am quite interested in politics and journalism I took part at a student simulation of the united nations last year in New York and I regurlary participate in writing contests for different newspapers (but until now without any luck). </p>

<p align ="justify">I have a more classical background as I did my Bachelor in Lausanne. Currently I'm doing my masters in Management in the Business Analytics orientation. It is true that Switzerland is a beautiful country and even more so in our part with the lake and the alps! I am a big fan of the lake and especially enjoy nautical sports such as wakeboarding and waterskiing during the summer. Of course when winter is around, I enjoy the snow as well.

Something worth mentioning is that I am not a Swiss citizen. I am half German and the other half is Brazilian. Although I have lived pretty much my whole life here, I have not yet asked to be naturalized.I guess the reason is that the mandatory military service is not that appealing...</p>

<p align ="justify">As a lover of fantastic worlds and creative stories, one of my favourite hobbies is certainly gaming: similarly to reading books, it allows me to completely detach from the stressful reality when I need it. I forget all my worries for a while and wander around in a world that is both exciting and completely different from the one we live in. I especially like playing with some internet friends and share the experience with them. 
However, Just like many passions, it is better to control it and not to go overboard with it; we might lose touch with reality too much and give priority to the wrong things.

A fun little fact about me would be that I am named after my grandfather, Ferdinando - who was named after an Italian king  - and we also shared the same family name: Pepe. I am thus the second Ferdinando Pepe of my family and was really proud of it as a little boy, since my grandfather was someone I really looked up to.</p>
